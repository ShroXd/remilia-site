# Unit Options

When you create the `remilia` instance, you can pass some options via `WithUnitOptions` to customize the behavior of the unit.

```go
rem, _ := remilia.New(
    remilia.WithUnitOptions(
        // put your options at here
        remilia.WithConcurrency(10),
    ),
)
```

## `WithConcurrency`

You can set the concurrency for the unit. The concurrency is the maximum number of goroutines that can be run at the same time.

The default value is `1`.

```go
remilia.WithConcurrency(10),
```

## `WithInputBufferSize`

You can set the input buffer size for the unit. The input buffer size is the maximum number of input messages that can be stored in the input channel.

The default value is `0`.

```go
remilia.WithInputBufferSize(100)
```
