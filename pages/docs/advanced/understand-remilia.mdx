# Understand Remilia

In the actually webiste, the information that needs to be extracted does not necessarily exist on the same page. Therfore, if we want to develop a web scraper or crawler, we need to develop multiple parsers for different kinds of page, the responsiblity of framework is orgranize these parsers and call them in the right order.

In Golang, we can easily develop a pipeline consist of multiple parsers by using `chan` and `goroutine`. At each level of unit of the pipeline, we can use Fan-out/Fan-in pattern to distribute the work and collect the result. Between each level, we can use `chan` to connect them.

By adjusting the number of goroutines and capacity of channels, we can control the speed of the pipeline and the memory usage.
